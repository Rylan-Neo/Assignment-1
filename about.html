                <h2>Hello! I am John Maxwell</h2><br>
                <a>I have been a photographer for 7 years, and have travelled around the world to take photos of anything and everything that interests me.</a><br><br>
                <a>I studied in Oxford University for 2 years at the age of 24 pursuing a masters in Classic Literature, however, I dropped out because I 
                didn't have enough money to pay for the tuition fees and had to take on many small scale freelancing jobs to earn money.</a><br><br>
                <a>I picked up photography after a friend gifted me a Canon EOS 4000D as a gift because he didn't have any use for it. I played the role of photographer
                when attending a few of my relatives weddings, and even for some of my close friends. </a><br><br>
                <a>However, photography is just my hobby, I am by no means a professional.</a><br><br>
                <a>Photos are taken using a Canon EOS 4000D, but sometimes I use my Samsung S23 phone.</a><br><br>
